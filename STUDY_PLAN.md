# College Intro Statistics — Study Plan

## How to Use This Plan
Work through each unit in order. Each unit builds on the previous one. For each unit, you'll find:
- **Key concepts** to understand
- **Practice focus** — what to drill
- **Visual explainer ideas** — concepts that benefit from interactive visuals

As you progress, we'll create practice problem sets and interactive visualizations for each unit.

## Tips for Success
1. **Do problems by hand first** — then check with a calculator. Understanding the process matters more than speed.
2. **Always interpret in context** — stats is about real-world meaning, not just numbers.
3. **Draw pictures** — sketching distributions, boxplots, and scatterplots builds intuition.
4. **Know your conditions** — every inference procedure has conditions. Learn to check them.
5. **Focus on vocabulary** — stats has precise language. "Correlation" doesn't mean "causation." A "significant" result doesn't mean "important."
