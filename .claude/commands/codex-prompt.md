# Codex Prompt Generator

When this skill is invoked:
1. DO NOT implement any code. Only produce markdown prompt files.
2. Ask the user which phase/scope to target.
3. Output one file per prompt in the project root directory (e.g., `codex_prompt_A.md`).
4. Each prompt must include: objective, constraints, file targets, verification steps.
5. Never execute the generated prompts.
